# AI Security Demonstration Project

This repository contains a Python-based project that demonstrates key principles of AI safety and security.

## Features
1. **Input Sanitization**: Detects and blocks potentially harmful input patterns.
2. **Privacy Protection**: Ensures sensitive user data is not leaked.
3. **Behavior Mitigation**: Handles unintended input behaviors, such as excessive input length.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `ai_security_demo.py` script using Python 3.x.
3. Follow the prompts to test different security features.

## Example Tests
- Enter a command like `rm -rf` to test input sanitization.
- Input sensitive information (e.g., `password123`) to see privacy protection in action.
- Provide excessively long queries to evaluate behavior mitigation.

## Instructions for Specialists
1. Test the system with various inputs to evaluate its robustness.
2. Provide feedback on areas of improvement or additional safeguards.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
